# Add TLS to AKS Ingress

This repository demonstrates how to add Kubernetes Ingress to a cluster in Azure Kubernetes Services. Moreover, it covers adding TLS termination to custom domain (i.e. www.example.com) using Let's Encrypt free services.

## Motivation

I own a Visual Studio subscription which gives me monthly [Azure credits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-azure). I wantto optimize the credits usage to run my blog and temporarly experiments seamlessly. Additionally, I would like to use my own domain.

Since I don't expect continuous and high load in any of the workloads a good option is to use AKS with [B-series VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/b-series-burstable). In short, B-series VMs store credits during low load, spending them during higher load. It is perfect for burst/seasonal workloads.

End goal:

```text
                                            |- blog.<your-domain>  -> external url
                                            |
mydomain.io -> Azure DNS -> AKS -> Ingress -|- demo1.<your-domain> -> demo1 svc
                                            |
                                            |- demo2.<your-domain> -> demo2 svc
```

New deployments should be able to create TLS terminated sub-domains.
